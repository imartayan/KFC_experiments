You can clone the repository and its submodules with
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/imartayan/KFC_experiments.git

If you did not use the `--recursive` flag, make sure to load the submodules with
```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Setup

If you have not installed Rust yet, please visit [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) to install it.
Once this is done, you can build all the tools with

```
